debathena-pyhesiodfs (0.0.r150-0debathena3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fix a typo in the /lib/init/vars.sh part of the previous commit (which
    was a work in progress and intentionally not committed).
  * Revert /dev/fuse change, pending further investigation (/dev/fuse is
    supposewd to be managed by udev).
